# Sprint 2 Review - AI-VR Education System

## Sprint Overview
- **Duration**: Three weeks (26/8/2024 - 16/9/2024)
- **Objective**: Complete foundational tasks related to student interaction with AI, teacher account creation, and basic system functionality.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Integration with OpenAI Assistant API
- Successfully integrated OpenAI Assistant API into the system.
- Implemented secure storage and handling of API keys.
- Developed C# scripts in Unity for managing HTTP requests to the OpenAI Assistant API.

### 2. Speech Recognition and Response Handling
- Implemented Speech-to-Text functionality for converting user voice to text.
- Developed Text-to-Speech capability to vocalize AI responses.
- Integrated these features seamlessly with the OpenAI Assistant API.

## Partially Completed Tasks

### 1. Interface and Interaction Testing
- Completed basic 2D window interface for initial testing.
- Conducted preliminary usability tests with a small focus group.
- **Reason for Partial Completion**: Full 3D scene development is planned for Sprint 3.

### 2. Final Integration and Review
- Performed initial integration of completed components.
- Conducted basic end-to-end testing of available features.
- **Reason for Partial Completion**: Full integration is pending the completion of user authentication system and 3D environment.

## Uncompleted Tasks

### 1. Student and Teacher Account Creation
- **Reason**: The integration of AI functionalities proved more challenging than anticipated, particularly in making API calls from C#, an area where the team lacked prior experience.

### 2. Login Functionality
- **Reason**: As with account creation, this task was deprioritized due to the unexpected complexity of AI integration.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Technical Complexity**: The team encountered difficulties in integrating the OpenAI API with C#, which required more time and resources than initially estimated.
2. **Skill Gap**: The team's lack of experience in making API calls from C# led to a steeper learning curve.
3. **Time Management**: The focus on overcoming AI integration challenges resulted in less time for user authentication tasks.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Importance of Skill Assessment**: Future sprint planning should include a more thorough assessment of the team's technical capabilities in relation to planned tasks.
2. **Flexibility in Task Prioritization**: The ability to reprioritize tasks based on emerging challenges was crucial in ensuring key functionalities were delivered.
3. **Value of Technical Research**: More upfront research into potential technical challenges could have helped in more accurate time estimation.

## Plans for Sprint 3
1. Complete the 3D scene development for a more immersive user experience.
2. Shift the responsibility of user authentication (account creation and login functionality) to the backend team.
3. Enhance and refine the AI interaction based on initial testing feedback.
4. Conduct more comprehensive usability testing with the integrated 3D environment.

## Conclusion
While Sprint 2 faced some unexpected challenges, particularly in AI integration, the team successfully delivered core functionalities related to AI interaction and speech processing. The experience gained in this sprint will be valuable in improving estimation and planning for future sprints. The team is committed to addressing the remaining tasks in Sprint 3 and is optimistic about delivering a more complete and robust system.
