# Git Version Control System

## GITHUB Version Control System

GITHUB version control system is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work together to track changes to source code files.

## GITHUB version control system core features (advantages)

- **Branch management**. Everyone can access the database using their own device

- **Distributed architecture**. Protect data security

- **Efficient code merge**. Accelerate collaborative development efficiency

## Basic Git operation list

1. **Initialize repository**: Use `git init` to create a new Git repository, or use `git clone` to clone an existing project from a remote repository.

2. **Add files**: Use `git add` to add changed files to the staging area.

3. **Commit changes**: Use `git commit` to commit changes and add commit information.

4. **Push changes**: Use `git push` to push local changes to the remote repository.

5. **Pull updates**: Use `git pull` to pull changes from the remote repository and merge them into the local branch.
6. **Create a branch**: Use `git branch` to create a new branch, and use `git checkout` to switch to the branch for development.
7. **Merge branches**: After completing development, use `git merge` to merge the branch into the main branch.
