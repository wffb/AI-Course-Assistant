### API

OpenAI's transcription and translation based on the open-source large-v2 Whisper model

- Transcribe audio to any language.
- Translate and transcribe audio to English.
- Currently, the file upload limit is 25 MB, and the following input file types are supported: mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, and webm.
- One of the few open-source models provided by OpenAI, with high acceptance and complete documentation.
- Support local deployment

### Advantages of using Whisper
1. **Multilingual Versatility :** Whisper is highly capable in handling a broad range of languages and dialects, making it ideal for global applications that require consistent performance across diverse linguistic backgrounds.

2. **Robustness in Noisy Environments:** Whisper’s training on a varied dataset enables it to perform well even in noisy environments or with challenging audio inputs, making it more reliable in unpredictable real-world scenarios.

3. **Local Processing and Privacy:** Whisper can be run entirely on local hardware, offering superior privacy and security by keeping data in-house. This is crucial for applications dealing with sensitive information or where compliance with strict data protection regulations is required.

4. **Cross-Lingual Capabilities:** Whisper’s ability to transcribe and translate across multiple languages in a single pass makes it a strong candidate for applications that need to handle multilingual content seamlessly.

5. **Open Source Flexibility:** Whisper is open-source, allowing developers to experiment, modify, and deploy the model in various ways that suit their specific needs. This flexibility can be a major advantage in research, innovation, and deployment scenarios.
