| U14 | Achieve a personified AI interaction using a 3D model in Unity | As a Student, I want to talk to the AI agent in a personified way using a 3D model of a person, so that I can talk to the AI agent as naturally as talking to a human being. | AC1: The 3D model appears friendly and professional, appropriate for educational environments.<br>AC2: The 3D model must have fluid animations that sync accurately with AI-generated speech, including gestures that correspond to natural human interactions.<br>AC3: The script effectively trigger appropriate model animations when system speaking responce.<br>AC4: The camera can be smoothly moved using the keyboard and mouse. The camera should not move outside predefined boundaries to prevent disorientation or breaking the immersive experience. | High     | 4                         | None       |

## User Case 7 - 3D Model Creation and Interaction

### User case: As a Student, I want to be able to interact with items in the virtual environment, so that I can have a more specific and clear understanding of the items I am learning.
