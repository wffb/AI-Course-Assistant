# Core Functionality Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the procedures for testing the core functionalities of our AI-VR Education System, focusing on the speech-to-text-to-AI-to-speech pipeline.

## 2. Test Objectives

- Verify that speech input can be successfully captured through Unity
- Ensure accurate conversion of speech to text
- Confirm that the AI module can generate appropriate responses based on text input
- Validate the text-to-speech conversion
- Test the end-to-end flow of the entire process

## 3. Test Environment

- Software: Unity [2022.3.44f1], AI module [chatgpt4o], Speech-to-Text API [chatgpt4o], Text-to-Speech API [chatgpt4o]
- Operating System: Windows

## 4. Test Cases

### 4.1 Speech Input Capture Test

**Objective**: Verify that speech input can be successfully captured through Unity.

**Steps**:
1. Launch the Unity application
2. Navigate to the speech input interface
3. Speak a predetermined phrase into the microphone
4. Verify that the application indicates successful audio capture

**Expected Result**: The application should show a visual or log indication that audio has been captured.

### 4.2 Speech-to-Text Conversion Test

**Objective**: Ensure accurate conversion of speech to text.

**Steps**:
1. Use the captured audio from Test 4.1
2. Initiate the speech-to-text conversion process
3. Compare the generated text with the spoken phrase

**Expected Result**: The generated text should accurately reflect the spoken phrase with minimal errors.

### 4.3 AI Response Generation Test

**Objective**: Confirm that the AI module can generate appropriate responses based on text input.

**Steps**:
1. Input the text generated from Test 4.2 into the AI module
2. Trigger the AI to generate a response
3. Verify that a response is generated
4. Evaluate the relevance and coherence of the response

**Expected Result**: The AI should generate a relevant and coherent response to the input text.

### 4.4 Text-to-Speech Conversion Test

**Objective**: Validate the text-to-speech conversion.

**Steps**:
1. Take the AI-generated response from Test 4.3
2. Input the text into the text-to-speech module
3. Play the generated audio
4. Evaluate the clarity and naturalness of the speech

**Expected Result**: The generated speech should be clear, understandable, and sound natural.

### 4.5 End-to-End Flow Test

**Objective**: Test the end-to-end flow of the entire process.

**Steps**:
1. Start with a new spoken phrase
2. Follow through steps from Tests 4.1 to 4.4 in sequence
3. Time the entire process from speech input to speech output
4. Verify that each component hands off to the next correctly

**Expected Result**: The entire process should flow smoothly from speech input to AI-generated speech output, with each component working correctly in sequence.

## 5. Test Data

Prepare a set of test phrases covering various scenarios:
- Simple questions (e.g., "What is the capital of France?")
- Complex queries (e.g., "Explain the process of photosynthesis")
- Conversational statements (e.g., "Tell me more about that")

## 6. Pass/Fail Criteria

- Each individual test (4.1 to 4.4) must pass for its respective functionality
- The end-to-end flow test (4.5) must complete successfully within [specify acceptable time frame, e.g., 10 seconds]
- Speech recognition and text-to-speech accuracy should be at least 95%
- AI responses should be relevant and coherent in at least 90% of cases

## 7. Reporting

Document the results of each test, including:
- Test case ID
- Pass/Fail status
- Any errors or unexpected behavior
- Time taken for each step (especially for the end-to-end test)
- Notes on speech recognition accuracy and AI response quality

## 8. Conclusion

This test plan covers the core functionalities of our AI-VR Education System's speech and AI interaction pipeline. Successful execution of these tests will verify that the system can accurately capture speech, convert it to text, generate AI responses, and convert those responses back to speech in a seamless flow.
