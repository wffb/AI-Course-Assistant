# Practical Test Cases for AI-VR Education System

## 1. Speech-to-Text Accuracy Tests

### Test Case 1.1: Simple Phrase
**Input**: "Hello, how are you today?"
**Expected Output**: "Hello, how are you today?"
**Acceptance Criteria**: 100% accuracy

### Test Case 1.2: Complex Scientific Term
**Input**: "The process of photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy."
**Expected Output**: "The process of photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy."
**Acceptance Criteria**: At least 90% accuracy (allow for minor errors in scientific terms)

### Test Case 1.3: Fast Speech
**Input**: [Speak rapidly] "Can you tell me quickly about the history of artificial intelligence?"
**Expected Output**: Approximate match to "Can you tell me quickly about the history of artificial intelligence?"
**Acceptance Criteria**: At least 80% accuracy, core meaning preserved

### Test Case 1.4: Sentence with Uncommon Names
**Input**: "Dmitri Mendeleev created the periodic table of elements."
**Expected Output**: Approximate match, names may be misspelled
**Acceptance Criteria**: Names should be recognizable, even if not perfectly spelled

### Test Case 1.5: Sentence with Background Noise
**Input**: [With background noise] "The capital of France is Paris."
**Expected Output**: "The capital of France is Paris."
**Acceptance Criteria**: At least 90% accuracy

## 2. End-to-End Flow Tests

### Test Case 2.1: Simple Question and Answer
**Speech Input**: "What is the boiling point of water?"
**Expected Text Output**: "What is the boiling point of water?"
**Expected AI Response**: [A correct explanation of water's boiling point]
**Final Speech Output**: [Clear audio matching the AI's text response]
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- Speech-to-text: At least 95% accuracy
- AI response: Correct and relevant
- Text-to-speech: Clear and understandable

### Test Case 2.2: Complex Query with Potential for Misrecognition
**Speech Input**: "Can you explain the difference between mitosis and meiosis in cell division?"
**Expected Text Output**: Approximate match, allowing for minor errors
**Expected AI Response**: [A comparison of mitosis and meiosis]
**Final Speech Output**: [Clear audio matching the AI's text response]
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Speech-to-text: At least 85% accuracy, core meaning preserved
- AI response: Correct explanation based on recognized text
- Text-to-speech: Clear and understandable

### Test Case 2.3: Conversational Flow
**Speech Input**: "Tell me about black holes."
**Expected Text Output**: "Tell me about black holes."
**Expected AI Response**: [Brief explanation about black holes]
**Final Speech Output**: [Clear audio matching the AI's text response]

[User listens to response, then continues]

**Speech Input**: "That's interesting. Can you elaborate on the event horizon?"
**Expected Text Output**: Approximate match to "That's interesting. Can you elaborate on the event horizon?"
**Expected AI Response**: [Detailed explanation of the event horizon]
**Final Speech Output**: [Clear audio matching the AI's text response]
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Speech-to-text: At least 90% accuracy across both inputs
- AI response: Contextually appropriate, building on previous interaction
- Text-to-speech: Clear and understandable

## 3. Error Handling Test

### Test Case 3.1: Unintelligible Input
**Speech Input**: [Mumble incomprehensibly]
**Expected Behavior**: 
1. System should indicate that the speech was not recognized
2. Prompt user to repeat the input
3. AI should not attempt to respond to unrecognized input

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System correctly identifies unintelligible input
- Provides clear feedback to the user
- Doesn't proceed with AI response for unrecognized input

## Test Execution Instructions

1. Perform each test case at least 3 times to account for variability in speech recognition.
2. For speech input, use a clear voice at a normal speaking pace unless otherwise specified.
3. Record the actual text output from speech recognition for each attempt.
4. Note any discrepancies between expected and actual results.
5. For end-to-end tests, evaluate the relevance and correctness of AI responses based on the recognized text, not the original speech input.
6. Ensure text-to-speech output is clear and matches the AI's text response.

## Reporting

For each test case, report:
1. Number of attempts
2. Success rate (percentage of attempts that met acceptance criteria)
3. Any consistent errors or issues observed
4. Overall pass/fail status based on the acceptance criteria

This practical test plan focuses on real-world scenarios, particularly the potential inaccuracies in speech-to-text conversion. It assumes perfect performance for AI responses and text-to-speech conversion, as per your specifications. The plan includes a mix of simple and complex inputs, as well as an error handling scenario, to thoroughly test your system's capabilities and limitations.
