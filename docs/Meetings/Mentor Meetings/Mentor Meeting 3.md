### Meeting Agenda:

1. Clarification of Baseline Requirements:
   - Discussion based on feedback from both the client and the professor regarding the SWEN90009 project requirements.
2. Proposal for Initial Development Phase:

   - Consideration of client's suggestion for starting with a 2D version of the software.

3. Presentation of Current Work:

   - Team presented ongoing work to the mentor for feedback.

4. Planning for Retrospective Meeting:

   - Arrangement for an upcoming retrospective meeting to evaluate the sprint's progress.

### Decisions:

1. Baseline Requirements:

   - The mentor confirmed that we could select baseline requirements based on our practical capacity, as long as we provide clear documentation justifying our choices. This approach addresses the professor's initial expectation to include all requirements from the SWEN90009 repository, which we deemed beyond our scope for the semester.

2. Development Strategy:

   - Upon the client's advice, and with the mentor's approval, it was decided to initially develop a 2D version of the software that includes AI conversation features. This strategy aims to match our current technical capabilities and provides a foundational step towards potentially integrating VR functionality later.

### Next Steps:

1. Document the selected baseline requirements and the rationale behind each choice
2. Schedule a retrospective meeting for Sunday [25/08/2024] to assess the progress made during the sprint and plan adjustments if necessary.
