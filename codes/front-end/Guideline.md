# How to Run the Front-End Locally

Below are the steps to run the front-end application locally. Make sure you have navigated to the `front-end` folder in your command-line interface (terminal).

## Steps

1. Navigate to the `front-end` directory globally:

    ```bash
    cd front-end
    ```

2. Install npm (Node.js package manager) by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Install `react-router-dom` dependency:

    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```

4. Install `react-bootstrap` and `bootstrap` dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
    ```

5. Install `jwt-decode` dependency:

    ```bash
    npm install jwt-decode
    ```
 6. Install `axios` dependency:

    ```bash
    npm install axios
    ```   
7. Install `react-icons` dependency:
    ```bash
    npm install react-icons
    ```
## Run the Application

Once the above steps are completed, you can run the front-end application:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the running application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Notes
Make sure the back-end service is also running and responsive before running the front-end application.
If you encounter any issues, check the error messages in the terminal or console output for troubleshooting.
